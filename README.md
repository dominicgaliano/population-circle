# Circle Population

Inspired by https://www.tomforth.co.uk/circlepopulations/

I use Tom's circle population tool often and was inspired to try to build upon it in a scalable way. Some future goals I have include exploring caching options, better database indexing, and polygonal/free-form search areas.
